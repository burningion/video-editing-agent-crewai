# Video Editing Agent with CrewAI

**WIP**

This is a bare bones repo, showing how to add an MCP server to CrewAI. 

In this case, it adds my [video-editing-mcp](https://github.com/burningion/video-editing-mcp) server to do video editing, but it's not (yet!) written up in a way as to be able to autonomously generate an edit.

That's... _coming soon_&trade;.

## Installing

You'll need to clone this repo. From there make sure to export your VJ_API_KEY from videojungle and then:

```
$ uv sync
$ uv run hello.py
```
